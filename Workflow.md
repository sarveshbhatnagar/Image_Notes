# Task1 Load Images
Make class to load images 
Class should be general enough and reuseable if I need later.

# Task2 Process the image.
For this project, what I plan is to just grab all images, get max height and width and make all images of that size.

So Get Max width and Max Height


# Task3 Perform Image Resize.
In our case, we can edit the image to add white pixels.
For now, I will add white pixels to the right. Should work.

Add white pixels accordingly.

# Task4 Combine
After this what I would require is to combine all the images together.

Combine Images.

# Task5 Enable CommandLine Interface.
After this enable calling this via command line. Argparse must take input two things, the path and the type of images within that path.

Implement Argparse functionality 

Add it to the interface.
