# Image_Notes
 This project is a project where I aim to create a python script that joins multiple screenshots together into one single pdf making a single note file. Main motivation for me to do this project is for easy summarization and keeping tabs on paper that I read.


# Useage:

python /path/to/image/folder : It will automatically get all png files and stitch them together.

python /path/to/image/folder -tp="jpg" -out="/path/filename.pdf" will get all jpg from image folder and place a stitched pdf in some specific folder.

default type is png, default filename and path is stiched.pdf in current working directory.

Best way to install: Follow answers in the following link :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6967331/how-do-i-install-a-script-to-run-anywhere-from-the-command-line/39741427. and install it using name quick. (For quick notes :) )


Thank you for using. Appreciate it. Feel free to contribute.
